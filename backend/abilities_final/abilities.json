Attacks with a recharge turn, such as hyper beam, do not have to recharge; attacks with a preparation turn, such as fly, do not end up being used.

If it does not attempt to move, e.g. because it is asleep or frozen, whatever it would have done will be postponed until its next attempt; that is, it will either loaf around or move as usual, depending on what it last did.\n\nThis ability cannot be changed with worry seed, but it can be disabled with gastro acid, changed with role play, or traded away with skill swap.",
